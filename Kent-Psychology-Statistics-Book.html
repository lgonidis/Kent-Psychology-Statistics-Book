<p>As we will be working together for this academic year it would be very useful for all involved to establish some common practices and expectations. These are the aims of this introductory session, so today we will not be doing any programming in R or any statistical analysis. Instead we will be doing some basic files and folders tasks that will prepare us for the next weeks.</p>

<h2 number="1.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> A Note About the Following Tasks</h2>
<p>We encourage all students to work on their own laptops, if possible. However, for today’s lab session we want you to complete the following tasks using a University computer first. Later if you want, you can repeat these steps in your own computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="first-task" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2 number="1.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> First Task</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether you are working on your own computer or on a University one you should create a folder that you will be using to create all future projects. On your desktop, create a folder called <strong>PSYC3000 Labs</strong>. There are many different ways to achieve that, the quickest one is to <em>right-click</em> on your desktop, then select <em>new</em> and then <em>folder</em>. Make sure you name the folder <strong>PSYC3000 Labs</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="second-task-create-your-first-project" class="section level2" number="1.5">
<h2 number="1.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Second Task: Create your first project</h2>
<p>Run RStudio on a University Lab computer. We want you to create your first project in the newly created folder <strong>PSYC3000 Labs</strong>. On RStudio, click on <strong>File</strong>, then <strong>New Project</strong>. You will see a pop-up window with <strong>three</strong> options. Click on <strong>New Directory</strong>. You should always be creating New projects in their own new directory. Next, you will see a number of different options, click on the top one <strong>New Project</strong>. You will now be asked to name the directory of your new Project. We want you to name it <strong>Week 9</strong>. Furthermore, we want this directory to be in the <strong>PSYC3000</strong> folder. By they way <strong>directory</strong> is just an old school term for <strong>folder</strong>. <strong>Folder</strong> and <strong>directory</strong> are the same thing. So, click <strong>Browse</strong> next, then find the folder <strong>PSYC3000</strong> on your desktop and select it and click <strong>Open</strong>. Finally, click <strong>Create Project</strong>.</p>

<p>As mentioned in our Drop-In session and in our Module Outline, PSYC3000 have an assessed Module Participation component. This means you will have to complete a number of tasks every week in order to receive 10% at the end of the Autumn Term. Please do not close your RStudio. Go on Moodle, in Week 9, and then in the <strong>Moodle Module Participation</strong> section you should be able to see an activity called <strong>Week 9: Introductory Quiz</strong>. Click on it and answer the first question. This will be one of the ways that you will have to complete the weekly module participation component through your lab session. There will also be other ways that we will discuss in the future. You can take this quiz as many times as you want.</p>

<h2 number="3.1"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>In this week’s Lab session we will introduce you to some basic features of R. This will allow you to write your first basic scripts. It should be noted that R is a versatile programming language with numerous features and capabilities. However, we will be focusing on concepts that are directly relevant to us, as Psychologists. Therefore, do not consider this module and coursebook as an exhaustive guide to R, instead treat it as a spotlight that will be shedding light on specific topics and techniques.<br />
By the end of this Lab session you should have a clear understanding of the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variables</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Operators</strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Difference between script and console</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to create a new script and save it</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to add comments in your script</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to see the content of a variable in the Environment</strong></li>
<li><strong>How to write your own simple script to calculate an arithmetic expression</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="getting-things-ready" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2 number="3.2"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Getting Things Ready</h2>
<p>Ideally, we would like you to have your SP300 work organised. This will make your work easier to maintain but also help us to aid you when you get stuck. Therefore, we recommend creating a folder on your desktop called “SP300”. Inside that folder you should be creating a new project every week with week’s name. This will make it much easier for you to navigate back and forth from week to week and look at different aspects of your work. Before you proceed with the following steps make sure you have created a folder named “SP300” on your “Desktop” folder.</p>
</div>
<div id="starting-with-rstudio" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2 number="3.3"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Starting with RStudio</h2>
<p>Run RStudio and create a new project by clicking on File &gt;&gt; New Project … .Then select New Directory and then New Project. Enter a Directory name. As mentioned above we recommend naming the folder “Week 2” and by clicking Browse make sure you place that folder in your “SP300” folder that you created on your Desktop.Click “Create Project” to finalise creating your new project.</p>
<p>You should now be seeing <strong>three main windows</strong>, three <strong>Console</strong>, the <strong>Environment</strong>, and the <strong>Files</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="console" class="section level2" number="3.4">
<h2 number="3.4"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Console</h2>
<p>In the console we typically see the “&gt;” symbol and the cursor flashing next to it. we type in R commands straight away and execute them by hitting “Enter” or “Return”.
You can try it out. Go to your console and type the following and press “Enter”</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">+</span><span class="dv">2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once you have done that you should be able to see the result of the calculation:</p>
<p>[1] 5</p>
<p>So with the above command line we executed a simple calculation, an addition of 3 and 2. The symbol <strong>+</strong> is called an <strong>operator</strong>. R accepts a number of operators, for more information on operators see: <a href="https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/operator/" class="uri">https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/operator/</a> . Most of them are straight forward and you have used them numerous times doing arithmetic calculations. For SP300 we will mostly be using the most common ones.<br />
Sometimes in programming we might want to carry out a calculation and use the results in many different occasions. We would not want to keep typing in the Console the same and the same operation, especially if it is a rather big expression. In order to save ourselves time and effort we can assign the result of an operation to <strong>variable</strong>. For example type the following in your Console and then hit “Enter”:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>p &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">3</span><span class="op">+</span><span class="dv">2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing the above, strangely we do not get any answer from R. Instead our Console looks like nothing really happened. In actual truth two things happened. First, R calculated the result of “3+2” and then it assigned the result of that calculation in to a <strong>variable</strong> called “p”. The reason that we do not see any result is because we did not instruct R to show the content of the variable “p”. If we want to see the content of the variable named “p” we have to type its name in the Console. Just type p and press enter. You should be able now to see the value that the variable p holds.</p>
<p>[1] 5</p>
<p>This is extremely valuable as I can now use the symbol p to refer to that content anywhere I need to, for example I can calculate the surface of a square with size equal to 5 (or p in this case). Type the following and press “Enter”.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>surface &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>p<span class="op">*</span>p</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>surface</span></code></pre></div>
<p>[1] 25</p>
<p>So you see now that R calculated the result of 5x5, then assigned it to a new variable called “surface” and then returned the value of “surface” in the console, 25. We will be using <strong>variables</strong> a lot in our work in SP300 and it is worth noting that a variable is not restricted to numerical content. Other types of data can also be assigned to a variable. For example characters:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a>day &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;Monday&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above variable “day” is what we called a character variable. Notice how we used the <strong>""</strong> symbols around the value that we want to assign.</p>
</div>
<div id="environment" class="section level2" number="3.5">
<h2 number="3.5"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Environment</h2>
<p>Usually the <strong>Environment</strong> window is on the top right side of our session. It includes valuable information about our work. For example you might already be able to see that it shows our two variable p and surface as well as their values. It also includes some other tabs next to the Environment but we will discuss those in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="files" class="section level2" number="3.6">
<h2 number="3.6"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Files</h2>
<p>At the bottom right of our session (usually) we can see our <strong>Files</strong> window. This includes information about the files that we are working on. At the moment you should be able to see just one file (probably), that shoud be your project name file. Next to Files we can also see a number of tabs that we will discuss in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="scripts" class="section level2" number="3.7">
<h2 number="3.7"><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Scripts</h2>
<p>Once we get more familiarised with R we will need to type a number of commands so we can complete more complex tasks than just simple arithmetic calculations. Furthermore, we might want to be able to run again and again with different data files. So typing commands straight into the Console would be rather time wasteful. A more efficient way to work is to create a <strong>script</strong> instead that will allow us to carry out many commands at once as well as save our work for future use.<br />
Let us create our first script. Go to File &gt;&gt; New File &gt;&gt; R Script . That should create a new Untitled script in a new window that just opened above the Console window. We will be referring to this new window as the <strong>script window</strong>. Let’s now go ahead and type a number of commands in our new script. Type the following commands as you see them below:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span class="co">## hourly refers to the hourly pay of £9 per hour</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>hourly &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">9</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span class="co">## hours refers to the number of hours I worked per day</span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>hours &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">7</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a><span class="co">## days refers to the number of days I worked in the current month</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8"></a>days &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">25</span></span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-10"><a href="#cb5-10"></a><span class="co">## the total salary can be calculated by multiplying all the above</span></span>
<span id="cb5-11"><a href="#cb5-11"></a>salary &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>hours<span class="op">*</span>hourly</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that you have typed all that nothing seems to be happening. This is because contrary to the Console, in a script a command is not executed when we press “Enter” or “Return”. Instead we have place our cursor in the line we want to execute and then click “Run”. When we click “Run” the lines is being executed and the cursor moves automatically to the next line, we click “Run” again and so on. Every time we click “Run” we can see the outcome in our Console, as well as in the Environment. Notice that our script also contains lines starting with <strong>“#”, these are comment lines</strong> that I include in my code to make it easier to read and understand. The use of “#” and comments is highly advisable and considered as **a good practice*. You should spend some time now to visually explore the screen in front you. Familiarise yourself with the different windows and click on different tabs to see what kind of information they contain. Also do not forget to save our script giving it a meaningful name. I suggest something like “the most amazing script”. You can save it by clicking File &gt;&gt; Save, and then type a name of your preference. Once you do that you should be able to see the new scripts in the “Files” window too.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercise" class="section level2" number="3.8">
<h2 number="3.8"><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Exercise</h2>
<p>Create a new script and name it “Exercise1”. Write the necessary lines of code that can solve the following problem:<br />
“The price for one cinema ticket is £10. The price for a large popcorn in £8. The price for one soft drink is £4. We want to calculate the total amount of money we spent if we bought 5 tickets, 3 popcorns and 4 soft drinks”. Make sure you create a variable for each of the above costs, as well as one variable for the total. Also, make sure to include detailed comments as the ones in the example above. Once you finish the script run all the commands and discuss the result with your group mates. If you all agree with the answer then report it back to the main channel.</p>

<p>In this week’s lab session we will start working on some basic concepts of statistical exploration of data. One of the first steps we take as Psychologists when we want to analyse our data, is first to get a “feel”, or gist if you want, of how are data are <strong>distributed</strong>.</p>
<p>By the end of this Lab session you should have a clear understanding of the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vectors</strong></li>
<li><strong>Functions and Arguments</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating Random Data for Practice Purposes</strong></li>
<li><strong>Grouping Data using R</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating Frequency Tables using R</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating a basic Histograms using R</strong></li>

<h2 number="4.2"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Vectors</h2>
<p>Let us assume that we asked 15 participants to report their age. One way to record this in R would be to use one variable per participant. It would look something like the following (DO NOT TYPE THE FOLLOWING IN RSTUDIO!!)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a>age1 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">18</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>age2 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">20</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a>age3 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">35</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a><span class="co"># and so on all the way down until we reach</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a>age15 &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">32</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see this would take 15 variables. Not only it would look horrible but also it would be a very wasteful way to store our information.</p>
<p>For cases where we want to store multiple observations single value variables are not the best way forward. Actually they are the worst way forward. Instead we can use a variable that can store many different values at once, a <strong>vector</strong>. The following is an example of a vector that stores our participants 15 ages. Please do type following in your R script and do run each line to see the output. You should name your R script “Week 3”.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> we always use <strong>c()</strong> to define a vector.</p>
<p>The same way we did calculations with simple value variables we can also do with vectors. For example, we may have a vector or prices for products and we may want to double the price of all of the products at once:</p>

<p>You see how powerful and handy vectors can be as they allow us to work with many values as once. We will be using vectors a lot in our work, as well as an extension of vectors called dataframes. (More about dataframes in the future)</p>

<h2 number="4.3"><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Creating vectors with random numbers</h2>
<p>As we do not have any real data yet, we might want to practice out learning with some made up data sets. That is absolutely fine but it poses a problem. If we want to create a vector with 200 made up values it will take us quite a while to actually type 200 values. Luckily, there is a solution to that. We can use an R <strong>function</strong> to create these numbers automatically. Let us see this in practice with a small example.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span class="co"># I am using a R function called sample.int()</span></span>

<p>As mentioned above, I used a function called <strong>sample.int()</strong>. A <strong>function</strong> in R, is a mechanism that can perform a task. In this case our function can select an integer number randomly. A function also includes two brackets (). Within these brackets we can specify our own arguments in order to be clear what we want R to do for us when this function is used.</p>
<p>Notice the number 10, this <strong>argument</strong> instructs our function that we want to pick randomly a number between 1 and 10.</p>
<p>Notice the second number 5, this <strong>argument</strong> instructs our function to give 5 such numbers from 1 to 10.</p>
<p>Notice the <strong>replace = TRUE</strong> part, this is another argument instructing R that numbers could be repeated. In other words, we can see the same number appearing more than once.</p>

<p>Let’s discuss the <strong>functions</strong> we used:</p>
<p><strong>sample.init()</strong> creates a sample of integer numbers</p>
<p><strong>cut()</strong> cuts our sample in smaller pieces. For arguments we had to provide our original sample (<strong>numbers</strong>). We then specified at what numbers we wanted the breaks to be (<strong>c(0,10,20,30,40,50)</strong>). Finally, we wanted the numbers on the right end of each group to be included in the count.</p>
<p><strong>summary()</strong> prints out the group frequency table, we only need one argument here, the variable that contains the grouped data (<strong>groups</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>hist()</strong> creates a histogram from our original sample (<strong>not the grouped one!!!</strong>). The arguments here were our sample (<strong>numbers</strong>), how many breaks we wanted (<strong>breaks = 5</strong>), and we wanted each bar to have its frequency at the top (<strong>labels = TRUE</strong>). As you can see we can define how many groups we want when we ask for our histogram. So when all we want is a histogram, then the <strong>cut()</strong> and <strong>summary()</strong> steps can be omitted. The histogram will do that behind the scenes and show us the frequencies in the graph. Try it out on your own by changing the number of breaks in the histogram.</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong> each time your run your code you will get a different frequency distribution and a different histogram. This is because we create these 200 numbers randomly and each time we are getting a new set.</p>
<p><strong>Learning opportunity</strong> from using random numbers. Run the above code many times, and each time observe the new histogram. Then discuss its <strong>skewness</strong> with your group mates. Does it look as <strong>positively</strong> or <strong>negatively</strong> <strong>skewed</strong>? Keep in mind your friends will have different graphs, so it is best to share your screen and show your histogram.</p>

<p>Create a random set of 200 integers between 1 and 40. Group that data in 8 groups and produce the grouped frequency table. Then produce a histogram using these 8 groups. Spend some time to experiments with the number of bars in the histogram as well as generating new random numbers. This will allow you to become good at judging the <strong>skewness</strong> of a <strong>frequency distribution</strong>.</p>

<h2 number="5.1"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> What we have learnt so far</h2>
<p>In the first two labs (Week 2 and Week 3) we learnt about variables, vectors, and operators. Furthermore, we were introduced to the used of functions and their arguments. These were the fundamental steps that we had to take before we can start carrying out statistical tasks. In the last lab session, we began exploring some basic statistical tasks such as creating grouped frequency tables and histograms. These steps, even though simple, they allowed us to develop a sense of our data. Creating visual representations of our data is one of R’s strongest aspects. For the time being we only practiced with <strong>hist()</strong> and <strong>pie()</strong>, however as we become more confident with R we will also explore some additional features that R <strong>packages</strong> can give us.</p>
<p>R in its core installation has a number of useful functions. However, these functions do not cover all the possible tasks we would wish to perform. In order to overcome this weakness R allows us to install and use additional <strong>packages</strong>. These packages are more specialised than the core R and can provide us with numerous new statistical tools. Today we will learn how to install and use such packages and see how they can provide us with useful new features. We will also see a number of examples of how to use R to acquire the <strong>mean, median, and mode</strong> of a sample. <strong>Finally, in order to make things more interesting we will use some experimental data that R offers by default. So today we will not be generating datasets comprised of random data.</strong> Instead we will be using some of the built-in datasets.</p>

<p><strong>If you are working on RStudio Cloud skip to step 1 below</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For this lab session you will need to create a new project in RStudio. Run RStudio and create a new project by clicking on File &gt;&gt; New Project … .Then select New Directory and then New Project. Enter a Directory name. As mentioned in Week 2, we recommend naming the folder by week, so “Week 4” would be ideal. Click Browse and make sure you place that folder in your “SP300” folder that you created on your Desktop.Click “Create Project” to finalise creating your new project.<br />
</li>
<li>Now create a new script from File &gt;&gt; New File &gt;&gt; R Script. Save your new script under the name <strong>Week 4</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the built-in datasets that R offers for free is called <strong>ToothGrowth</strong>.
The ToothGrowth data set contains the result from an experiment studying the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in 60 Guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).
Even though this dataset is not the result of Psychological research it does have the structure of a data file from Psychological research where we administer an intervention in three different dosages and two different methods. Let’s see how we can explore this dataset.</p>
<p>In your new script type and run the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span>(<span class="st">&quot;ToothGrowth&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This informs R that we want to work with the build-in dataset called “ToothGrowth”. If you have a look at your Environment you will now see under the section called <strong>Data</strong> an object called <strong>ToothGrowth</strong>. You will also see some additional information, it has 60 observations and 3 variables. If you also move your mouse pointer on top of <strong>ToothGrowth</strong> and leave it there you will get a tooltip window informing you that this is a <strong>data.frame</strong>. For now you can consider a data.frame as a table that contains information for more than one variables. If you click once on <strong>ToothGrowth</strong> then RStudio will open and display this data.frame for you. You can see it in a new tab that opened next to your script. You can see it has three columns, one per variable. The top row includes the variable names. <strong>len</strong> is the variable that contains information on the tooth growth, <strong>supp</strong> is the variable that contains information on the vitamin supplement used, and <strong>dose</strong> is the variable that describes the dosage that was administered.</p>
<p>If you type and run each the following commands one at a time you will see each variable displayed in your console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1"></a>ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>len</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><a href="#cb17-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb17-3"><a href="#cb17-3"></a>ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>supp</span>
<span id="cb17-4"><a href="#cb17-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb17-5"><a href="#cb17-5"></a>ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>dose</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So if I want to work with one of the variables in a dataset I can call it by typing the name of the dataset, then type the <strong>$</strong> symbol, and in after that type the name of the variable.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>
Try to create a histogram for the variable <strong>len</strong> of the dataset <strong>ToothGrowth</strong>. If you are not certain how to do this you can check the solution at the end of this pdf</p>

<div id="measures-of-central-tendency" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2 number="5.4"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Measures of Central Tendency</h2>
<p>Let us know see how we can use R functions to calculate the mean, median, and mode for a variable. If we want to find the mean of a variable we can use the function <strong>mean()</strong>. Similarly, if we want to find the median, we can use the <strong>median()</strong> function. Let’s see them in practice for the variable <strong>len</strong> of the <strong>Toothgrowth</strong> dataset.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1"></a><span class="co"># the following command will calculate the mean of len</span></span>
<span id="cb18-2"><a href="#cb18-2"></a><span class="kw">mean</span>(ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>len)</span>
<span id="cb18-3"><a href="#cb18-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb18-4"><a href="#cb18-4"></a><span class="co"># the following command will find the median value of len</span></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><a href="#cb18-5"></a><span class="kw">median</span>(ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>len)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see now how with one line of code we can find in an instant a figure that would have taken us much more time and energy to calculate by hand.</p>
<p>Now let’s see if we can also find the <strong>mode</strong> in a similar way. Try the following command and see what happens.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1"></a><span class="kw">mode</span>(ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>len)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You probably got the answer “numeric”. This is because the function <strong>mode()</strong> corresponds to a different task that what we hoped it would perform. Actually, the core installation of R does not have a function that can find the mode value of a variable. However, as we said earlier this is not a problem as we can install and run external packages that can add additional functionalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-a-new-package" class="section level2" number="5.5">
<h2 number="5.5"><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Adding a new package</h2>
<p>In order to have a function that can find the mode of our sample we need to install a new package called <strong>DescTools</strong>. We do that by clicking <strong>Tools</strong> in the menu and then <strong>Install Packages…</strong>. Then where it says packages type in <strong>DescTools</strong> and click <strong>Install</strong>. If you are promtped with any questions then click on <strong>Yes</strong>. RStudio will download and install everything automatically and you should be ready to go once you can see the <strong>&gt;</strong> symbol in the console. Once you install a package you can use it in all future projects and scripts without the need to re-install it. Now we can tell R that we want to use this package in our script by adding and running the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(DescTools)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As a good practice we tend to declare the packages we want to use at the top of our scripts. We also need to include the command <strong>library(DescTools)</strong> only once per script, if we need it at all.
Now we have the necessary function to find the <strong>mode</strong> of <strong>len</strong> by calling the function <strong>Mode()</strong> that comes with the package <strong>DescTools</strong>. Add the following command and run it to get the mode.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(DescTools)</span>
<span id="cb21-2"><a href="#cb21-2"></a><span class="kw">Mode</span>(ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>len)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You should get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: package &#39;DescTools&#39; was built under R version 4.0.3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 26.4
## attr(,&quot;freq&quot;)
## [1] 4</code></pre>
<p>This means that your mode is 26.4 and it has a frequency of 4.</p>

<p>Another dataset that comes build-in with R is called <strong>iris</strong>. iris dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The following exercises should be completed in one script and are in practice one exercise. They are broken down to smaller questions to make your work easier, as well as making it easier to refer to the solutions in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>
Create a new script and name it <strong>week 4 iris</strong>. Then type in and execute the right command in order to load the dataset <strong>iris</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>
Explore the data.frame called <strong>iris</strong> (you can find it in your <strong>Environment</strong>). You should be able to see that some of the included variables are <strong>Sepal.Length</strong>, <strong>Sepal.Width</strong>, <strong>Petal.Length</strong>, and <strong>Petal.Width</strong>. Write the right code that would create one histogram for each of the above variables. Do spend some time to observe each histogram and think about how the scores are distributed and whether we have <strong>skewed</strong> distributions. (CAUTION: In R upper case and lower case letter do matter, make sure to type them exactly as you see them)</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>
Type the right code in order to get the <strong>mean</strong> and the <strong>median</strong> for all the above variables.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong>
Type the right code in order to get the <strong>mode</strong> for all the above variables. (Hint: do not forget the <strong>library</strong> and remember the importance of upper case letters.)

<p>In the previous two weeks (Week 3 and Week 4), we have covered descriptive statistics and we have focused on <strong>measures of central tendency</strong> and <strong>measures of dispersion</strong>, In this week’s lab session we will bring everything together and we will also expand our work with skills that will allow us to present the above information visually.</p>

<p><strong>If you are working on RStudio Cloud skip to step 1 below</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For this lab session you will need to create a new project in RStudio. Run RStudio and create a new project by clicking on File &gt;&gt; New Project … .Then select New Directory and then New Project. Enter a Directory name. As mentioned in Week 2, we recommend naming the folder by week, so “Week 6” would be ideal. Click <strong>Browse</strong> and make sure you place that folder in your “SP300” folder that you created on your Desktop.Click “Create Project” to finalise creating your new project.<br />
</li>
<li>Now create a new script from File &gt;&gt; New File &gt;&gt; R Script. Save your new script under the name <strong>Week 6</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Our first step would be to install the package <strong>ggpubr</strong>. This package allows to create customisable plots that we can include in our documents, either assignments or publications. Type the following in your console and press Enter in order to install <strong>tidyverse</strong> and <strong>ggpubr</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>install.packages(“tidyverse”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>install.packages(“ggpubr”)</strong></p>
<p>One of the built-in datasets that R offers for free is called <strong>ToothGrowth</strong>.
The ToothGrowth data set contains the result from an experiment studying the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in 60 Guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).
Even though this dataset is not the result of Psychological research it does have the structure of a data file from Psychological research where we administer an intervention in three different dosages and two different methods. We have worked with this dataset before but this time we will expand our work with more descriptive statistics and plots.</p>

<p>This informs R that we want to work with the package <strong>ggpubr</strong> andf the build-in dataset called “ToothGrowth”. If you have a look at your Environment you will now see under the section called <strong>Data</strong> an object called <strong>ToothGrowth</strong>. You will also see some additional information, it has 60 observations and 3 variables. If you also move your mouse pointer on top of <strong>ToothGrowth</strong> and leave it there you will get a tooltip window informing you that this is a <strong>data.frame</strong>. For now you can consider a data.frame as a table that contains information for more than one variables. If you click once on <strong>ToothGrowth</strong> then RStudio will open and display this data.frame for you. You can see it in a new tab that opened next to your script. You can see it has three columns, one per variable. The top row includes the variable names. <strong>len</strong> is the variable that contains information on the tooth growth, <strong>supp</strong> is the variable that contains information on the vitamin supplement used, and <strong>dose</strong> is the variable that describes the dosage that was administered.</p>
<p>If you type and run each the following commands one at a time you will see each variable displayed in your console. This is pretty similar to what we did in <strong>Week 4</strong>.</p>

<p>We will now start using our newly acquired knowledge of <strong>measures of dispersion</strong> and expand our skill-set. First, we can get all the basic descriptine information about our dataset with just one command line <strong>summary()</strong></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb38-1"><a href="#cb38-1"></a><span class="kw">summary</span>(ToothGrowth)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##       len        supp         dose      
##  Min.   : 4.20   OJ:30   Min.   :0.500  
##  1st Qu.:13.07   VC:30   1st Qu.:0.500

##  3rd Qu.:25.27           3rd Qu.:2.000  
##  Max.   :33.90           Max.   :2.000</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the <strong>summary()</strong> functions returns the min, max, mean, median, Q1 and Q3 with just one execution. However, there are also some differences. Our variable <strong>len</strong> is a numerical variable and that is why we get all this information. Where as our variable <strong>supp</strong> is a factor with 2 levels and we only get a summary of how many cases we have in each level of the variable. In this case we see 30 for OJ and 30 for VC. As it was mentioned in the methods lecture of week 4, some variables are measurement variables whereas others can be manipulated variables. The variables we manipulate we also call them <strong>Independent Variables</strong> (IV). When we manipulate variables then the measurement variables are our <strong>Dependent Variables</strong> or <strong>DV</strong>.</p>
<p>Manipulated variables have to have at least two levels. For example the <strong>supp</strong> variable is a variable that we manipulated and we assigned <strong>participants</strong> randomly to one of the two conditions, <strong>levels</strong>. These two levels were VC and OJ. Similarly, <strong>dose</strong> is also a variable we manipulated and it has three levels, <strong>0.5</strong>, <strong>1.0</strong>, and <strong>2.0</strong>.</p>
<p>In your environment, you should be able to see an object called <strong>ToothGrowth</strong>. If you click on the little blue circle with the white triangle, you will get more information about <strong>ToothGrowth</strong>. We see that <strong>len</strong> is numerical, which is correct as this was our <strong>DV</strong>, we also see that <strong>supp</strong> is a factor with 2 levels. Finally. we see that <strong>dose</strong> is also numerical, this is not correct. R does not always know/recognise the type or our variables. In this case we have to inform R that <strong>dose</strong> is also a factor. We will do that using the function <strong>as.factor()</strong>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb40-1"><a href="#cb40-1"></a>ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>dose &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.factor</span>(ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>dose)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With the above code we informed R that the variable dose that is part of the ToothGrowth dataframe is a factor. Let’s run the summary again and see whether the information we are getting is now different.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb41"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb41-1"><a href="#cb41-1"></a><span class="kw">summary</span>(ToothGrowth)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##       len        supp     dose   
##  Min.   : 4.20   OJ:30   0.5:20

##  Median :19.25           2  :20  
##  Mean   :18.81                   
##  3rd Qu.:25.27                   
##  Max.   :33.90</code></pre>
<p>You see now that we no longer get any numerical descriptive results. We only get a count of how many cases are in each level of the factor. This means that now R has properly identified our IVs. <strong>When you work with data make sure your first step is to always check the variable and assign factors to your IVS</strong>. Since <strong>len</strong> is our only DV then we will focus on this one for our descriptives today. The following functions are self-explanatory, make sure to also add some comments in your code.</p>

<div id="exploring-data-using-boxplots" class="section level2" number="7.5">
<h2 number="7.5"><span class="header-section-number">7.5</span> Exploring data using boxplots</h2>
<p>One of the best plots we can create in order to visualise the <em>spread</em> of a variable is <strong>boxplot</strong>. Boxplots contain information on the minimum and maximum values. They also include Q1, median, and Q3. Let us have a look.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb44"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb44-1"><a href="#cb44-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(ggpubr) <span class="co">### do not type this line if you already included at the top of your script</span></span>
<span id="cb44-2"><a href="#cb44-2"></a><span class="kw">ggboxplot</span>(ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>len)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As you can see the boxplot is comprised of a <strong>box</strong> and two <strong>lines</strong>. The lower point of the line represents the min and the higher point represents the max. The horizontal line inside the box represents the median, and the lower and upper sides of the box represent the Q1 and Q3 respectively. Boxplots are even more informative if we use them to plot different variables, or create different boxplot per level of a factor. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb45"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb45-1"><a href="#cb45-1"></a><span class="kw">ggboxplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So now we can see one boxplot per level of <strong>dose</strong>. Visually, the three doses seem to differ from each other. In the second term we learn how we can investigate whether these differences are meaningful or a product of chance. Back to our dataset now, we also have a second IV called <strong>supp</strong>, we can ask ggboxplot to use that IV to create more boxplots. That way we will have one boxplot per combination of the IV cells. We will explain this further below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb46"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb46-1"><a href="#cb46-1"></a><span class="kw">ggboxplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">color =</span> <span class="st">&quot;supp&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So what we see here is six boxplots. With red colour we see all the box plots that correspond to the participants assigned to the <strong>OJ</strong> level, with <strong>blue</strong> we see all the boxplots that correspond to the participants assigned to the <strong>VC</strong> level. We still have the levels of the <strong>dose</strong> on the x-axis. This representation helps us have some visual information about our data. For example for the dose of 1mg we see that the VC boxplot is rather compressed, so we can say that our data in that combination had a rather small spread. Contrary the boxplot of the 2mg in the VC condition is much larger, so the data were spread much more in that condition.</p>
<p>You can also swap position between dose and supp in the x variable and the color.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb47"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb47-1"><a href="#cb47-1"></a><span class="kw">ggboxplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;supp&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">color =</span> <span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Can you ficure out what do these boxplots represent? Instead of having three pairs, we now have two triads. Also, if you dont like white boxes you can use <strong>fill</strong> instead of <strong>color</strong>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb48"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb48-1"><a href="#cb48-1"></a><span class="kw">ggboxplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;supp&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">fill =</span> <span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<div id="exploring-data-using-barcharts" class="section level2" number="7.6">
<h2 number="7.6"><span class="header-section-number">7.6</span> Exploring data using barcharts</h2>
<p>While boxplots are great for visually exploring our data they mainly represent the mean, the IQR, and the range. When we want to represent the mean of different groups we tend to use <strong>barcharts</strong>. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb49"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb49-1"><a href="#cb49-1"></a><span class="kw">ggbarplot</span>(ToothGrowth<span class="op">$</span>len)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This is a very basic version of a barchart that just includes all our DV measurements. Ideally we would want to see the mean of our DV for each level of an IV. For example the mean of len per level of dose.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb50"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb50-1"><a href="#cb50-1"></a><span class="kw">ggbarplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This is a very basic barchart and it also contains all individual measurements points as horizontal lines. We are interested in the mean.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb51"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb51-1"><a href="#cb51-1"></a><span class="kw">ggbarplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">add =</span> <span class="st">&quot;mean&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It would also be great to see the standard deviation of each group. We can do that by using <strong>add = “mean_sd”</strong> instead of just <strong>add = “mean”</strong>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb52"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb52-1"><a href="#cb52-1"></a><span class="kw">ggbarplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">add =</span> <span class="st">&quot;mean_sd&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>These vertical lines are called <strong>error bars</strong> with the upper part being called <strong>upper error bar</strong> and the lower part <strong>lower error bar</strong>. In this case the upper and lower error bar is equal to the standard deviation. Furthermore, all the tricks we used for the boxplot can also be used here. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb53"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb53-1"><a href="#cb53-1"></a><span class="kw">ggbarplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">fill =</span> <span class="st">&quot;supp&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">add =</span> <span class="st">&quot;mean_sd&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This does not really look great. This is because ggbarplot dre each bar on top of each other. We want them next to each other. We need to add an argument that will move the bars next to each other.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb54"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb54-1"><a href="#cb54-1"></a><span class="kw">ggbarplot</span>(ToothGrowth, <span class="dt">x=</span><span class="st">&quot;dose&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">y =</span> <span class="st">&quot;len&quot;</span>, <span class="dt">fill =</span> <span class="st">&quot;supp&quot;</span>, </span>
<span id="cb54-2"><a href="#cb54-2"></a>          <span class="dt">position =</span> <span class="kw">position_dodge</span>(<span class="fl">0.7</span>) , <span class="dt">add =</span> <span class="st">&quot;mean_sd&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="Kent-Psychology-Statistics-Book_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Both ggboxplot andd ggbarplot come numerous more arguments. Remember to use the help function or google them to see what other option you have. We will also using them a lot in the coming weeks so we will learn quite a few more arguments.</p>

<p>The variable id corresponds to participant id, the variable gender and age as self-explanatory. The variables <strong>use1</strong> to <strong>use6</strong> represent 6 questions with regards to the use of internet. The variables <strong>pre1</strong> to <strong>pre6</strong> represent 6 questions with regards to how preoccupied with thoughts about Internet someone is. The variables <strong>comfort1</strong> and <strong>comfort2</strong> are two questions with regards to how comforting someone finds the Internet to be. <strong>Days</strong> and <strong>hours</strong> represent how many days a week and how many hours a day someone spends on the Internet.</p>
<p>Even though we could run correlation analysis for each question this is not meaningful, in this case. What we want to do is calculate three new variables. One variable that would be the average use of internet (mean of use1 to use6), one variable that would be average preoccupation (mean of pre1 to pre6), and one variable that would be the average of comforting, mean of comfort1 and comfort2. So in reality we want to add three new columns to our dataframe that will include the results of the above three calculations.</p>
<p><strong>use_mean</strong>: mean of use1 to use6 for each participant
<strong>pre_mean</strong>: mean of pre1 to pre6 for each participant<br />
<strong>comf_mean</strong>: mean of comfort1 and comfort2 for each participant.
<strong>total_hr</strong>: the total amount of hours in a week
We can achieve the above with many different ways, for this term we will focus on using the function <strong>mutate()</strong>.</p>

<h2 number="8.5"><span class="header-section-number">8.5</span> Creating a new dataset and executing all correlations at once</h2>
<p>As you have seen above it is quite a lot of work to keep typing the same code for each pair of variables. One way to overcome this is to use the function, correlation(). This function, takes as an input our entire dataframe and runs correlations for all the existing variables. The problem with this approach is that our dataframe may also have variables that we do not want to include. An easy way to fix this would be to create a new dataframe that only contains the variables we need. Then run correlation on the new dataframe. We can do that by using the function select() and declare the variables we want to copy to the new dataframe.</p>

att1,att2,att3,bel1,bel2,bel3,bel4,stance1,stance2,stance3,stance4,ethic1,ethic2,ethic3. You should create new variables that would be the average of the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>att_mean: att1, att2, att3<br />
</li>
<li>bel_mean: bel1, bel2, bel3, bel4</li>
<li>stance_mean: stance1,stance2,stance3,stance4<br />
</li>
<li>ethic_mean: ethic1, ethic2, ethic3</li>

<p>Then explore correlations by creating scatterplots for the above four variables.<br />
Also, create a new datafile that will only include these four variables and run all correlations at once using the new dataframe.</p>

<p>In this week’s session we will be focusing on working with existing code and fixing mistakes as we go along.
This is a crucial lab session and you should do your best to work on your own. You can very briefly chat with your lab mates but try to ask for minimal help from our teaching assistants, not at all if possible. We will go through the answer tomorrow in the Drop-In session.</p>

<h2 number="9.2"><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> To start with</h2>
<p>First, start RStudio and create a new project. Your project should be named “Week 8 lab”</p>
<p>Go on moodle in week 8 in the lab session and download two files.<br />
1. “many many many errors.csv”<br />
2. “many many many errors.R”</p>
<p>Make sure you save both files in the folder you just created for your new project.<br />
Once you have that then load the R script and start working through the instructions that are included in the script as comments.
In order to load the script go to File &gt; Open File then select the “many many many errors.R” file and click on Open.</p>
<p>As you work through the file, keep an eye for typing mistakes, packages that we have not loaded, variables that are mistyped, dataframes that are not declared. Also, functions that do not give you an error but do not do what you want if you do not typed them correctly (remember mode vs Mode a few weeks ago).</p>

You should work together as a group and bring your dataset in a form where you can carry out correlational analysis. If you have createrd a project in RStudio in week 9 then you should continue working in that same project. This means that you have already downloaded the file <strong>“project data.csv”</strong>. <strong>If not</strong> then you should create a new project in RStudio and You should download the <strong>“project data.csv”</strong> file from moodle and save it in your project folder. You should then assign it to a dataframe and start working towards your analysis.Once the following is completed without any errors you should be good to start working within your group.

<h3 number="12.6.1"><span class="header-section-number">12.6.1</span> Computer Programming Anxiety (CPAQ) (Brief Version)</h3>
<p>This brief version of the questionnaire is comprised of 15 items. The full version of the questionnaire is much longer. However, for the purposes of our coursework this brief versions will be more than suitable. These 15 items are:<br />
1. GICS_1 to GIS_4 (Gaining Initial Computing Skills, GICS).<br />
2. SoC_1 to SoC_3 (Sense of Control, SOC).<br />
3. CSC_1 to CSC_4 (Computer Self Concept, CSC).<br />
4. SACS_1 to SACS_4 (State of Anxiety in Computer Situations, SACS).</p>
<p>You should calculate four means. The <strong>GICS</strong>, <strong>SOC</strong>, <strong>CSC</strong>, and the <strong>SACS</strong>. Once you have these four means then you need to calculate a final variable called <strong>CPAQ</strong> that will be average of <strong>GICS</strong>, <strong>SOC</strong>, <strong>CSC</strong>, and the <strong>SACS</strong>.</p>

<p>You will have to investigate for associations between <strong>Maths Anxiety</strong>, <strong>Testing Anxiety</strong>, and <strong>two other constructs</strong> of your choice from the list below. Which one is entirely up to you. However, make sure you link the four in your introduction so that your hypothesis and rationale behind the study are sound.</p>
<p>You will have to produce a group report of 2,000 words (maximum). In this word count the references and the appendices are not included. In other words, the word count includes everything you have written from the abstract until the end of your discussion. This limit is the absolute maximum, which means you cannot go above it, you can however write below 2,000 words.</p>
<p>On Moodle, there is a template file that you will have to use to write the report. You have to use that file as we want you to also fill in the first pages of the report. In these pages all group members will be listed and you will have to acknowledge all the members that actually attended and contributed. This is crucial as we want to be fair and only award students who have worked on the project.</p>

<p>Continuing from last week you should be working on the report data. Today we will focus specifically on a technique called <strong>reverse coding</strong>. This technique is crucial for the groups that chose <strong>Computer Programming Anxiety (CPAQ)</strong> or <strong>Computer Programming Anxiety (CPAQ) Prior to joing our course</strong>. Even if your group has not chosen the above two variables you should complete today’s lab as this topic may well be in the upcoming statistics in-class test.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-reverse-coding" class="section level2" number="13.4">
<h2 number="13.4"><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> What is reverse coding?</h2>
<p>When coding and analysing questions from a questionnaire it is vital that all our questions have the same direction prior to the analysis. What do we mean by that? Have a look at the following two example statements:<br />
1. I find statistics easy (1: strongly disagree - 5: strongly agree)<br />
2. Statistics are challenging for me (1: strongly disagree - 5: strongly agree)<br />
It is clear from the working that these two statements are expressing two opposites (easy stats vs challenging stats). However, the answering scale has the same direction. This could create problems for our analysis. Lets see an example to better illustrate this. Lets us imagine a student who finds statistics <strong>easy</strong>. This means they would choose 4 for the first question would most probably choose 2 in the second question. If we calculate the mean as is we would get a mean of 3 which would not represent that individual’s disposition of finding statistics easy. Instead it would place them at the center which prepresents finding statistics neither easy or difficult.</p>

<h2 number="13.5"><span class="header-section-number">13.5</span> So how do we deal with this?</h2>
<p>In order to avoid such issues we reverse code the questions that do not follow the direction that the rest of the questions are following. This is more clear if we see some of the items from the <strong>Computer Programming Anxiety (CPAQ)</strong>. This questionnaire is comprised of 4 sub_scales that are not always coded for the same direction. We will have to fix that before calculating the overall questionnaire score. Below we will only include information for the CPAQ but you will have to follow a similar approach for the CPAQ Prior to joining.</p>

<h3 number="13.5.1"><span class="header-section-number">13.5.1</span> Computer Programming Anxiety (CPAQ) (Brief Version)</h3>
<p>This brief version of the questionnaire is comprised of 15 items. The full version of the questionnaire is much longer. However, for the purposes of our coursework this brief versions will be more than suitable. These 15 items are:<br />
1. GICS_1 to GIS_4 (Gaining Initial Computing Skills, GICS).<br />
2. SoC_1 to SoC_3 (Sense of Control, SOC).<br />
3. CSC_1 to CSC_4 (Computer Self Concept, CSC).<br />
4. SACS_1 to SACS_4 (State of Anxiety in Computer Situations, SACS).</p>
<p><strong>GICS</strong>: GICS_1 to GCIS_4 are all pointing to higher anxiety for higher scores. So no action needs to be taken.</p>
<p><strong>SoC</strong>: SoC_1 and SoC_2 indicate higher anxiety for higher score. However, SoC_3 needs to be reverse-coded as high score is associated with low anxiety. The following code should be inserted in your existing script from week 10 right after this line:
<strong>df &lt;- mutate(df, GICS = (GICS_1 + GICS_2 + GICS_3 + GICS_4)/4)</strong>. In other words the following lines are affecting your CPAQ calculations. If you did not include the CPAQ calculations then just add them straight after loading your data file.</p>

<p>Lets explain the code above. First we create a new variable/column called <strong>SoC_3_r</strong>. It is a convention to just use the original name and then add **_r** in the end so we know that this is the reverse coded item. Then we calculated the difference <strong>6-SoC_3</strong>. We did this because <strong>SoC_3</strong> has answer from 1 to 5 so if we want to reverse the order then we have to substract from 6. That way 1 will become 5, 2 will become 4, 3 will remain 3, 4 will become 2, and 5 will become 1. If our scale was 1-7 we would have to subtract from 8.</p>
<p>You now need to recalculate the correct mean for <strong>SoC</strong>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb65"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb65-1"><a href="#cb65-1"></a>df &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(df, <span class="dt">SOC =</span> (SoC_<span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span>SoC_<span class="dv">2</span> <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span>SoC_<span class="dv">3</span>_r)<span class="op">/</span><span class="dv">3</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that I now used the <strong>SoC_r</strong> item and not the <strong>SoC</strong>. This is crucial so keep that in mind. We need to reverse code an item but also use the new item in the calculation.</p>
<p>Lets see now the rest two subscales <strong>CSC</strong> and <strong>SACS</strong>. For <strong>CSC</strong> we see that items 3 and 4 need to be reversed. We will reverse them and calculate the new mean.</p>

<p>Looking at the SACS questionnaire we see that the second item needs reverse coding. We will do that and calculate the new mean for SACS. Keep in mind here that SACS is 1-4 scale so we will need to subtract from 5.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb67"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb67-1"><a href="#cb67-1"></a>df &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(df, <span class="dt">SACS_2_r =</span> <span class="dv">5</span> <span class="op">-</span><span class="st"> </span>SACS_<span class="dv">2</span>)</span>

<p>We are now ready to calculate the new overall mean for CPAQ. Once you do that then the rest of your analysis code should be the same which means all you have to do is rerun to get the updated results. This is one of the most valuable strengths of R/RStudio as it allows to make changes and correct our work without losing all of our work.</p>
<p>You can continue working with your analysis/results/method section work now.</p>
