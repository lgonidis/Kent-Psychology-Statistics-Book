This will allow you to write your first basic scripts. It should be noted that R is a versatile programming language with numerous features and capabilities. However, we will be focusing on concepts that are directly relevant to us, as Psychologists. Therefore, do not consider this module and coursebook as an exhaustive guide to R, instead treat it as a spotlight that will be shedding light on specific topics and techniques. By the end of this Lab session you should have a clear understanding of the following concepts: Variables Operators Difference between script and console How to create a new script and save it How to add comments in your script How to see the content of a variable in the Environment How to write your own simple script to calculate an arithmetic expression 2.2 Getting Things Ready Ideally, we would like you to have your SP300 work organised. This will make your work easier to maintain but also help us to aid you when you get stuck. Therefore, we recommend creating a folder on your desktop called SP300. Inside that folder you should be creating a new project every week with weeks name. This will make it much easier for you to navigate back and forth from week to week and look at different aspects of your work. Before you proceed with the following steps make sure you have created a folder named SP300 on your Desktop folder. 2.3 Starting with RStudio Run RStudio and create a new project by clicking on File &gt;&gt; New Project  .Then select New Directory and then New Project. Enter a Directory name. As mentioned above we recommend naming the folder Week 2 and by clicking Browse make sure you place that folder in your SP300 folder that you created on your Desktop.Click Create Project to finalise creating your new project. You should now be seeing three main windows, three Console, the Environment, and the Files. 2.4 Console In the console we typically see the &gt; symbol and the cursor flashing next to it. we type in R commands straight away and execute them by hitting Enter or Return. You can try it out. Go to your console and type the following and press Enter 3+2 Once you have done that you should be able to see the result of the calculation: [1] 5 So with the above command line we executed a simple calculation, an addition of 3 and 2. The symbol + is called an operator. R accepts a number of operators, for more information on operators see: https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/operator/ . Most of them are straight forward and you have used them numerous times doing arithmetic calculations. For SP300 we will mostly be using the most common ones. Sometimes in programming we might want to carry out a calculation and use the results in many different occasions. We would not want to keep typing in the Console the same and the same operation, especially if it is a rather big expression. In order to save ourselves time and effort we can assign the result of an operation to variable. For example type the following in your Console and then hit Enter: p &lt;- 3+2 By doing the above, strangely we do not get any answer from R. Instead our Console looks like nothing really happened. In actual truth two things happened. First, R calculated the result of 3+2 and then it assigned the result of that calculation in to a variable called p. The reason that we do not see any result is because we did not instruct R to show the content of the variable p. If we want to see the content of the variable named p we have to type its name in the Console. Just type p and press enter. You should be able now to see the value that the variable p holds. [1] 5 This is extremely valuable as I can now use the symbol p to refer to that content anywhere I need to, for example I can calculate the surface of a square with size equal to 5 (or p in this case). Type the following and press Enter. surface &lt;- p*p surface [1] 25 So you see now that R calculated the result of 5x5, then assigned it to a new variable called surface and then returned the value of surface in the console, 25. We will be using variables a lot in our work in SP300 and it is worth noting that a variable is not restricted to numerical content. Other types of data can also be assigned to a variable. For example characters: day &lt;- &quot;Monday&quot; The above variable day is what we called a character variable. Notice how we used the \"\" symbols around the value that we want to assign. 2.5 Environment Usually the Environment window is on the top right side of our session. It includes valuable information about our work. For example you might already be able to see that it shows our two variable p and surface as well as their values. It also includes some other tabs next to the Environment but we will discuss those in the future. 2.6 Files At the bottom right of our session (usually) we can see our Files window. This includes information about the files that we are working on. At the moment you should be able to see just one file (probably), that shoud be your project name file. Next to Files we can also see a number of tabs that we will discuss in the future. 2.7 Scripts Once we get more familiarised with R we will need to type a number of commands so we can complete more complex tasks than just simple arithmetic calculations. Furthermore, we might want to be able to run again and again with different data files. So typing commands straight into the Console would be rather time wasteful. A more efficient way to work is to create a script instead that will allow us to carry out many commands at once as well as save our work for future use. Let us create our first script. Go to File &gt;&gt; New File &gt;&gt; R Script . That should create a new Untitled script in a new window that just opened above the Console window. We will be referring to this new window as the script window. Lets now go ahead and type a number of commands in our new script. Type the following commands as you see them below: ## hourly refers to the hourly pay of £9 per hour hourly &lt;- 9 ## hours refers to the number of hours I worked per day hours &lt;- 7 ## days refers to the number of days I worked in the current month days &lt;- 25 ## the total salary can be calculated by multiplying all the above salary &lt;- hours*hourly Now that you have typed all that nothing seems to be happening. This is because contrary to the Console, in a script a command is not executed when we press Enter or Return. Instead we have place our cursor in the line we want to execute and then click Run. When we click Run the lines is being executed and the cursor moves automatically to the next line, we click Run again and so on. Every time we click Run we can see the outcome in our Console, as well as in the Environment. Notice that our script also contains lines starting with #, these are comment lines that I include in my code to make it easier to read and understand. The use of # and comments is highly advisable and considered as **a good practice*. You should spend some time now to visually explore the screen in front you. Familiarise yourself with the different windows and click on different tabs to see what kind of information they contain. Also do not forget to save our script giving it a meaningful name. I suggest something like the most amazing script. You can save it by clicking File &gt;&gt; Save, and then type a name of your preference. Once you do that you should be able to see the new scripts in the Files window too. 2.8 Exercise Create a new script and name it Exercise1. Write the necessary lines of code that can solve the following problem: The price for one cinema ticket is £10. The price for a large popcorn in £8. The price for one soft drink is £4. We want to calculate the total amount of money we spent if we bought 5 tickets, 3 popcorns and 4 soft drinks. Make sure you create a variable for each of the above costs, as well as one variable for the total. Also, make sure to include detailed comments as the ones in the example above. Once you finish the script run all the commands and discuss the result with your group mates. If you all agree with the answer then report it back to the main channel. "],["Week3.html", "Week 3 Lab Session 2 3.1 Learning Objectives 3.2 Vectors 3.3 Creating vectors with random numbers 3.4 Frequency tables in R and Histograms 3.5 Exercise 2 3.6 Exercise 3", " Week 3 Lab Session 2 3.1 Learning Objectives In this weeks lab session we will start working on some basic concepts of statistical exploration of data. One of the first steps we take as Psychologists when we want to analyse our data, is first to get a feel, or gist if you want, of how are data are distributed. By the end of this Lab session you should have a clear understanding of the following concepts: Vectors Functions and Arguments Creating Random Data for Practice Purposes Grouping Data using R Creating Frequency Tables using R Creating a basic Histograms using R Before we begin, do make sure you start a new project and name it Week 3. If you are running RStudio Cloud do not start a new project, continue working on the same one from last week. 3.2 Vectors Let us assume that we asked 15 participants to report their age. One way to record this in R would be to use one variable per participant. It would look something like the following (DO NOT TYPE THE FOLLOWING IN RSTUDIO!!) age1 &lt;- 18 age2 &lt;- 20 age3 &lt;- 35 # and so on all the way down until we reach age15 &lt;- 32 As you can see this would take 15 variables. Not only it would look horrible but also it would be a very wasteful way to store our information. For cases where we want to store multiple observations single value variables are not the best way forward. Actually they are the worst way forward. Instead we can use a variable that can store many different values at once, a vector. The following is an example of a vector that stores our participants 15 ages. Please do type following in your R script and do run each line to see the output. You should name your R script Week 3. # We are creating a vector c and we are populating it with 15 values # Then we assign it to a variable called Age Age &lt;- c(18, 18, 20, 32, 45, 33, 19, 19, 20, 58, 63, 21, 19, 19, 18) # If we call the variable Age we will get all 15 values Age [1] 18 18 20 32 45 33 19 19 20 58 63 21 19 19 18 # But we can also access any of the 15 entries we want by calling its &quot;location&quot; Age[7] [1] 19 Note we always use c() to define a vector. The same way we did calculations with simple value variables we can also do with vectors. For example, we may have a vector or prices for products and we may want to double the price of all of the products at once: # We are creating a vector c and we are populating it with 5 prices. # The prices could be in £ or any other currency (we only type the value in). # Then we assign our vector to a variable called Prices. Prices &lt;- c(115, 120, 200, 300, 500) # call Price to see the values in the console Prices [1] 115 120 200 300 500 # We now want a new variable that will include the old prices doubled. # We can call the new variable anything we want, let us call it Newprices Newprices &lt;- 2*Prices # call Price to see the values in the console Newprices [1] 230 240 400 600 1000 # But we can also access any of the 15 entries we want by calling its &quot;location&quot; Age[7] [1] 19 You see how powerful and handy vectors can be as they allow us to work with many values as once. We will be using vectors a lot in our work, as well as an extension of vectors called dataframes. (More about dataframes in the future) 3.3 Creating vectors with random numbers As we do not have any real data yet, we might want to practice out learning with some made up data sets. That is absolutely fine but it poses a problem. If we want to create a vector with 200 made up values it will take us quite a while to actually type 200 values. Luckily, there is a solution to that. We can use an R function to create these numbers automatically. Let us see this in practice with a small example. # I am using a R function called sample.int() # This function creates random integer numbers numbers &lt;- sample.int(10, 5, replace = TRUE) numbers [1] 10 4 2 8 7 As mentioned above, I used a function called sample.int(). A function in R, is a mechanism that can perform a task. In this case our function can select an integer number randomly. A function also includes two brackets (). Within these brackets we can specify our own arguments in order to be clear what we want R to do for us when this function is used. Notice the number 10, this argument instructs our function that we want to pick randomly a number between 1 and 10. Notice the second number 5, this argument instructs our function to give 5 such numbers from 1 to 10. Notice the replace = TRUE part, this is another argument instructing R that numbers could be repeated. In other words, we can see the same number appearing more than once. 3.4 Frequency tables in R and Histograms Let us now proceed to a larger data set comprised of 200 random integers between 1 and 50. We will organise that data in 5 groups and produce a grouped frequency table. Then lastly, we will create a histogram with the same 5 groups. # Similarly as above, I will call sample.int() # But this time I need 200 numbers between 1 and 50. # See how my arguments have now changed. numbers &lt;- sample.int(50, 200, replace = TRUE) numbers [1] 40 22 49 41 27 24 26 37 47 35 4 2 16 32 15 43 26 32 2 11 12 21 29 18 9 [26] 8 2 37 43 2 36 26 5 5 45 31 17 48 36 36 32 30 18 10 37 5 44 16 42 2 [51] 46 38 13 4 15 45 37 9 40 50 32 46 5 50 4 1 40 11 2 18 30 45 39 1 29 [76] 28 50 6 3 9 41 17 47 23 35 3 36 22 38 28 39 49 20 39 44 32 40 12 3 15 [101] 45 24 4 26 1 32 34 38 37 23 10 14 6 25 44 25 16 1 26 4 41 43 23 3 42 [126] 19 18 14 12 11 19 29 26 20 27 21 1 50 21 49 11 34 5 20 4 46 23 36 7 48 [151] 14 41 39 1 16 16 7 23 8 16 21 31 40 3 12 17 9 37 28 4 21 8 8 10 2 [176] 9 38 18 24 15 1 24 47 10 8 32 18 34 28 20 8 23 21 30 43 28 48 28 12 23 # Now we will call a new function to help us group our data. # First put them in 5 groups. The numbers in c() declare the numbers that define each group. groups &lt;- cut(numbers, breaks = c(0,10,20,30,40,50), right = TRUE) # Now I can produce my frequency table using another function summary(groups) (0,10] (10,20] (20,30] (30,40] (40,50] 50 38 41 38 33 # We will now use a new function called hist that creates histograms. # Note that this function has to work with the original numbers # and not with the groups. hist(numbers, breaks = 5, labels = TRUE) Lets discuss the functions we used: sample.init() creates a sample of integer numbers cut() cuts our sample in smaller pieces. For arguments we had to provide our original sample (numbers). We then specified at what numbers we wanted the breaks to be (c(0,10,20,30,40,50)). Finally, we wanted the numbers on the right end of each group to be included in the count. summary() prints out the group frequency table, we only need one argument here, the variable that contains the grouped data (groups). hist() creates a histogram from our original sample (not the grouped one!!!). The arguments here were our sample (numbers), how many breaks we wanted (breaks = 5), and we wanted each bar to have its frequency at the top (labels = TRUE). As you can see we can define how many groups we want when we ask for our histogram. So when all we want is a histogram, then the cut() and summary() steps can be omitted. The histogram will do that behind the scenes and show us the frequencies in the graph. Try it out on your own by changing the number of breaks in the histogram. Notice each time your run your code you will get a different frequency distribution and a different histogram. This is because we create these 200 numbers randomly and each time we are getting a new set. Learning opportunity from using random numbers. Run the above code many times, and each time observe the new histogram. Then discuss its skewness with your group mates. Does it look as positively or negatively skewed? Keep in mind your friends will have different graphs, so it is best to share your screen and show your histogram. 3.5 Exercise 2 Empty 3.6 Exercise 3 Create a random set of 200 integers between 1 and 40. Group that data in 8 groups and produce the grouped frequency table. Then produce a histogram using these 8 groups. Spend some time to experiments with the number of bars in the histogram as well as generating new random numbers. This will allow you to become good at judging the skewness of a frequency distribution.

Furthermore, we were introduced to the used of functions and their arguments. These were the fundamental steps that we had to take before we can start carrying out statistical tasks. In the last lab session, we began exploring some basic statistical tasks such as creating grouped frequency tables and histograms. These steps, even though simple, they allowed us to develop a sense of our data. Creating visual representations of our data is one of Rs strongest aspects. For the time being we only practiced with hist() and pie(), however as we become more confident with R we will also explore some additional features that R packages can give us. R in its core installation has a number of useful functions. However, these functions do not cover all the possible tasks we would wish to perform. In order to overcome this weakness R allows us to install and use additional packages. These packages are more specialised than the core R and can provide us with numerous new statistical tools. Today we will learn how to install and use such packages and see how they can provide us with useful new features. We will also see a number of examples of how to use R to acquire the mean, median, and mode of a sample. Finally, in order to make things more interesting we will use some experimental data that R offers by default. So today we will not be generating datasets comprised of random data. Instead we will be using some of the built-in datasets. 4.2 Learning objectives Installing R packages Calling R packages Use core R and packages to find measures of central tendency 4.3 Lets get started If you are working on RStudio Cloud skip to step 1 below For this lab session you will need to create a new project in RStudio. Run RStudio and create a new project by clicking on File &gt;&gt; New Project  .Then select New Directory and then New Project. Enter a Directory name. As mentioned in Week 2, we recommend naming the folder by week, so Week 4 would be ideal. Click Browse and make sure you place that folder in your SP300 folder that you created on your Desktop.Click Create Project to finalise creating your new project. Now create a new script from File &gt;&gt; New File &gt;&gt; R Script. Save your new script under the name Week 4. One of the built-in datasets that R offers for free is called ToothGrowth. The ToothGrowth data set contains the result from an experiment studying the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in 60 Guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC). Even though this dataset is not the result of Psychological research it does have the structure of a data file from Psychological research where we administer an intervention in three different dosages and two different methods. Lets see how we can explore this dataset. In your new script type and run the following: data(&quot;ToothGrowth&quot;) This informs R that we want to work with the build-in dataset called ToothGrowth. If you have a look at your Environment you will now see under the section called Data an object called ToothGrowth. You will also see some additional information, it has 60 observations and 3 variables. If you also move your mouse pointer on top of ToothGrowth and leave it there you will get a tooltip window informing you that this is a data.frame. For now you can consider a data.frame as a table that contains information for more than one variables. If you click once on ToothGrowth then RStudio will open and display this data.frame for you. You can see it in a new tab that opened next to your script. You can see it has three columns, one per variable. The top row includes the variable names. len is the variable that contains information on the tooth growth, supp is the variable that contains information on the vitamin supplement used, and dose is the variable that describes the dosage that was administered. If you type and run each the following commands one at a time you will see each variable displayed in your console: ToothGrowth$len ToothGrowth$supp ToothGrowth$dose So if I want to work with one of the variables in a dataset I can call it by typing the name of the dataset, then type the $ symbol, and in after that type the name of the variable. Exercise 1 Try to create a histogram for the variable len of the dataset ToothGrowth. If you are not certain how to do this you can check the solution at the end of this pdf 4.4 Measures of Central Tendency Let us know see how we can use R functions to calculate the mean, median, and mode for a variable. If we want to find the mean of a variable we can use the function mean(). Similarly, if we want to find the median, we can use the median() function. Lets see them in practice for the variable len of the Toothgrowth dataset. # the following command will calculate the mean of len mean(ToothGrowth$len) # the following command will find the median value of len median(ToothGrowth$len) You can see now how with one line of code we can find in an instant a figure that would have taken us much more time and energy to calculate by hand. Now lets see if we can also find the mode in a similar way. Try the following command and see what happens. mode(ToothGrowth$len) You probably got the answer numeric. This is because the function mode() corresponds to a different task that what we hoped it would perform. Actually, the core installation of R does not have a function that can find the mode value of a variable. However, as we said earlier this is not a problem as we can install and run external packages that can add additional functionalities. 4.5 Adding a new package In order to have a function that can find the mode of our sample we need to install a new package called DescTools. We do that by clicking Tools in the menu and then Install Packages. Then where it says packages type in DescTools and click Install. If you are promtped with any questions then click on Yes. RStudio will download and install everything automatically and you should be ready to go once you can see the &gt; symbol in the console. Once you install a package you can use it in all future projects and scripts without the need to re-install it. Now we can tell R that we want to use this package in our script by adding and running the following command: library(DescTools) As a good practice we tend to declare the packages we want to use at the top of our scripts. We also need to include the command library(DescTools) only once per script, if we need it at all. Now we have the necessary function to find the mode of len by calling the function Mode() that comes with the package DescTools. Add the following command and run it to get the mode. library(DescTools) Mode(ToothGrowth$len) You should get the following output: ## Warning: package &#39;DescTools&#39; was built under R version 4.0.3 ## [1] 26.4 ## attr(,&quot;freq&quot;) ## [1] 4 This means that your mode is 26.4 and it has a frequency of 4. 4.6 To sum up As we progress through our course we will be using specific packages and functions. You do not need to memorise the packages names. We will be providing those for you. You will also not need to memorise the names of the functions for this term. We will be providing those too. 4.7 Additional Exercises (spoiler alert: if you get stuck the answers are at the end of the pdf) Another dataset that comes build-in with R is called iris. iris dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The following exercises should be completed in one script and are in practice one exercise. They are broken down to smaller questions to make your work easier, as well as making it easier to refer to the solutions in the end. Exercise 2 Create a new script and name it week 4 iris. Then type in and execute the right command in order to load the dataset iris Exercise 3 Explore the data.frame called iris (you can find it in your Environment). You should be able to see that some of the included variables are Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, and Petal.Width. Write the right code that would create one histogram for each of the above variables. Do spend some time to observe each histogram and think about how the scores are distributed and whether we have skewed distributions. (CAUTION: In R upper case and lower case letter do matter, make sure to type them exactly as you see them) Exercise 4 Type the right code in order to get the mean and the median for all the above variables. Exercise 5 Type the right code in order to get the mode for all the above variables.

Run RStudio and create a new project by clicking on File &gt;&gt; New Project  .Then select New Directory and then New Project. Enter a Directory name. As mentioned in Week 2, we recommend naming the folder by week, so Week 6 would be ideal.

Now create a new script from File &gt;&gt; New File &gt;&gt; R Script. Save your new script under the name Week 6. Our first step would be to install the package ggpubr. This package allows to create customisable plots that we can include in our documents, either assignments or publications. Type the following in your console and press Enter in order to install tidyverse and ggpubr. install.packages(tidyverse) install.packages(ggpubr) One of the built-in datasets that R offers for free is called ToothGrowth. The ToothGrowth data set contains the result from an experiment studying the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in 60 Guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC). Even though this dataset is not the result of Psychological research it does have the structure of a data file from Psychological research where we administer an intervention in three different dosages and two different methods. We have worked with this dataset before but this time we will expand our work with more descriptive statistics and plots. 6.4 Range, Interquartile Range, Median, and Relevant Plots In your new script type and run the following: library(tidyverse) ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.0 -- ## v ggplot2 3.3.2 v purrr 0.3.4 ## v tibble 3.0.4 v dplyr 1.0.0 ## v tidyr 1.1.0 v stringr 1.4.0 ## v readr 1.3.1 v forcats 0.5.0 ## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() -- ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() library(ggpubr) data(&quot;ToothGrowth&quot;) This informs R that we want to work with the package ggpubr andf the build-in dataset called ToothGrowth. If you have a look at your Environment you will now see under the section called Data an object called ToothGrowth. You will also see some additional information, it has 60 observations and 3 variables. If you also move your mouse pointer on top of ToothGrowth and leave it there you will get a tooltip window informing you that this is a data.frame. For now you can consider a data.frame as a table that contains information for more than one variables. If you click once on ToothGrowth then RStudio will open and display this data.frame for you. You can see it in a new tab that opened next to your script. You can see it has three columns, one per variable. The top row includes the variable names. len is the variable that contains information on the tooth growth, supp is the variable that contains information on the vitamin supplement used, and dose is the variable that describes the dosage that was administered. If you type and run each the following commands one at a time you will see each variable displayed in your console. This is pretty similar to what we did in Week 4.

First, we can get all the basic descriptine information about our dataset with just one command line summary() summary(ToothGrowth) ## len supp dose ## Min. : 4.20 OJ:30 Min. :0.500 ## 1st Qu.:13.07 VC:30 1st Qu.:0.500 ## Median :19.25 Median :1.000 ## Mean :18.81 Mean :1.167 ## 3rd Qu.:25.27 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :33.90 Max. :2.000 You can see that the summary() functions returns the min, max, mean, median, Q1 and Q3 with just one execution. However, there are also some differences. Our variable len is a numerical variable and that is why we get all this information. Where as our variable supp is a factor with 2 levels and we only get a summary of how many cases we have in each level of the variable. In this case we see 30 for OJ and 30 for VC. As it was mentioned in the methods lecture of week 4, some variables are measurement variables whereas others can be manipulated variables. The variables we manipulate we also call them Independent Variables (IV). When we manipulate variables then the measurement variables are our Dependent Variables or DV. Manipulated variables have to have at least two levels. For example the supp variable is a variable that we manipulated and we assigned participants randomly to one of the two conditions, levels. These two levels were VC and OJ. Similarly, dose is also a variable we manipulated and it has three levels, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. In your environment, you should be able to see an object called ToothGrowth. If you click on the little blue circle with the white triangle, you will get more information about ToothGrowth. We see that len is numerical, which is correct as this was our DV, we also see that supp is a factor with 2 levels. Finally. we see that dose is also numerical, this is not correct. R does not always know/recognise the type or our variables. In this case we have to inform R that dose is also a factor. We will do that using the function as.factor(). ToothGrowth$dose &lt;- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose) With the above code we informed R that the variable dose that is part of the ToothGrowth dataframe is a factor. Lets run the summary again and see whether the information we are getting is now different. summary(ToothGrowth) ## len supp dose ## Min. : 4.20 OJ:30 0.5:20 ## 1st Qu.:13.07 VC:30 1 :20 ## Median :19.25 2 :20 ## Mean :18.81 ## 3rd Qu.:25.27 ## Max. :33.90 You see now that we no longer get any numerical descriptive results. We only get a count of how many cases are in each level of the factor. This means that now R has properly identified our IVs. When you work with data make sure your first step is to always check the variable and assign factors to your IVS. Since len is our only DV then we will focus on this one for our descriptives today. The following functions are self-explanatory, make sure to also add some comments in your code. mean(ToothGrowth$len) ## [1] 18.81333 median(ToothGrowth$len) ## [1] 19.25 range(ToothGrowth$len) ## [1] 4.2 33.9 IQR(ToothGrowth$len) ## [1] 12.2 var(ToothGrowth$len) ## [1] 58.51202 sd(ToothGrowth$len) ## [1] 7.649315 6.5 Exploring data using boxplots One of the best plots we can create in order to visualise the spread of a variable is boxplot. Boxplots contain information on the minimum and maximum values. They also include Q1, median, and Q3. Let us have a look. library(ggpubr) ### do not type this line if you already included at the top of your script ggboxplot(ToothGrowth$len) As you can see the boxplot is comprised of a box and two lines. The lower point of the line represents the min and the higher point represents the max. The horizontal line inside the box represents the median, and the lower and upper sides of the box represent the Q1 and Q3 respectively. Boxplots are even more informative if we use them to plot different variables, or create different boxplot per level of a factor. For example: ggboxplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;dose&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;) So now we can see one boxplot per level of dose. Visually, the three doses seem to differ from each other. In the second term we learn how we can investigate whether these differences are meaningful or a product of chance. Back to our dataset now, we also have a second IV called supp, we can ask ggboxplot to use that IV to create more boxplots. That way we will have one boxplot per combination of the IV cells. We will explain this further below. ggboxplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;dose&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;, color = &quot;supp&quot;) So what we see here is six boxplots. With red colour we see all the box plots that correspond to the participants assigned to the OJ level, with blue we see all the boxplots that correspond to the participants assigned to the VC level. We still have the levels of the dose on the x-axis. This representation helps us have some visual information about our data. For example for the dose of 1mg we see that the VC boxplot is rather compressed, so we can say that our data in that combination had a rather small spread. Contrary the boxplot of the 2mg in the VC condition is much larger, so the data were spread much more in that condition. You can also swap position between dose and supp in the x variable and the color. ggboxplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;supp&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;, color = &quot;dose&quot;) Can you ficure out what do these boxplots represent? Instead of having three pairs, we now have two triads. Also, if you dont like white boxes you can use fill instead of color. ggboxplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;supp&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;, fill = &quot;dose&quot;) 6.6 Exploring data using barcharts While boxplots are great for visually exploring our data they mainly represent the mean, the IQR, and the range. When we want to represent the mean of different groups we tend to use barcharts. For example: ggbarplot(ToothGrowth$len) This is a very basic version of a barchart that just includes all our DV measurements. Ideally we would want to see the mean of our DV for each level of an IV. For example the mean of len per level of dose. ggbarplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;dose&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;) This is a very basic barchart and it also contains all individual measurements points as horizontal lines. We are interested in the mean. ggbarplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;dose&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;, add = &quot;mean&quot;) It would also be great to see the standard deviation of each group. We can do that by using add = mean_sd instead of just add = mean. ggbarplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;dose&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;, add = &quot;mean_sd&quot;) These vertical lines are called error bars with the upper part being called upper error bar and the lower part lower error bar. In this case the upper and lower error bar is equal to the standard deviation. Furthermore, all the tricks we used for the boxplot can also be used here. For example: ggbarplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;dose&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;, fill = &quot;supp&quot;, add = &quot;mean_sd&quot;) This does not really look great. This is because ggbarplot dre each bar on top of each other. We want them next to each other. We need to add an argument that will move the bars next to each other. ggbarplot(ToothGrowth, x=&quot;dose&quot;, y = &quot;len&quot;, fill = &quot;supp&quot;, position = position_dodge(0.7) , add = &quot;mean_sd&quot;) Both ggboxplot andd ggbarplot come numerous more arguments. Remember to use the help function or google them to see what other option you have. We will also using them a lot in the coming weeks so we will learn quite a few more arguments. 6.7 Exercises The following graphs were made using ggboxplot and ggbarplot. We used the dataset mtcars. What you will have to do is use the right code to produce exactly the same graphs. When you load the mtcars dataset, the variables cyl and am are numerical. MAKE SURE YOU CONVERT THEM TO FACTOR AS YOUR FIRST STEP. Look carefully in each graph so you can identify the variables that you will have to use to generate them. 6.7.1 Exercise 1 6.7.2 Exercise 2 6.7.3 Exercise 3 6.7.4 Exercise 4 6.7.5 Exercise 5 "],["Week7.html", "Week 7 Lab Session 5 7.1 Before you proceed for this lab session 7.2 Learning objectives 7.3 Load our own data 7.4 Working with our data 7.5 Creating a new dataset and executing all correlations at once 7.6 Exercise", " Week 7 Lab Session 5 7.1 Before you proceed for this lab session In order to use your lab time more efficiently, make sure you complete the following steps first. 1.

Then click on Create Project. 3. Go on moodle on the SP300 page, in Week 6. In the lab section there are two files, internet.csv and exercisew7.csv. Download both files and save them or copy them in your Week 7 Lab folder that is on your desktop. IF YOU ARE A MAC USER PLEASE USE CHROME AND NOT SAFARI. 4. If you have done everything right, you should be able to see both files at the mottom right window in your RStudio, if the tab Files. 5. Create a new script and save it as week7. Then type in the following commands and run them. library(tidyverse) library(correlation) library(ggpubr) If you get any warning messages that is fine. If you get an error for a specific package then you probably have not installed it yet. You can install it if you run install.packages(\"packagename\") in your console. Please check your group membership before coming to the lab. If for any reason you cannot see your relevant channel then click show hidden channels. If for some reason you cannot join any of the meetings, then restart your Teams application and/or your computer. 7.2 Learning objectives load our own data files in RStudio Use mutate() function to add new variables in the dataset Create a scatterplot for our variables Run correlation analysis to explore associations Create new dataframes that will only contain the variables we want Run multiple correlations in one step 7.3 Load our own data If you have already followed the steps above you should already have two data files in your folder. These are internet.csv and exercisew7.csv. We will execute the following script to load internet.csv and also get some useful initial summaries. The internet.csv contains data from a sudy that measured participants Internet use. If you have already created the week7 lab script above then just continue working from there. If not make sure you add the three lines above that contain the libraries. ## load the file internet.csv and assign to a dataframe called df df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;internet.csv&quot;) ## Let&#39;s have a quick look at our variables in df summary(df) 7.4 Working with our data The variable id corresponds to participant id, the variable gender and age as self-explanatory. The variables use1 to use6 represent 6 questions with regards to the use of internet. The variables pre1 to pre6 represent 6 questions with regards to how preoccupied with thoughts about Internet someone is. The variables comfort1 and comfort2 are two questions with regards to how comforting someone finds the Internet to be. Days and hours represent how many days a week and how many hours a day someone spends on the Internet. Even though we could run correlation analysis for each question this is not meaningful, in this case. What we want to do is calculate three new variables. One variable that would be the average use of internet (mean of use1 to use6), one variable that would be average preoccupation (mean of pre1 to pre6), and one variable that would be the average of comforting, mean of comfort1 and comfort2. So in reality we want to add three new columns to our dataframe that will include the results of the above three calculations. use_mean: mean of use1 to use6 for each participant pre_mean: mean of pre1 to pre6 for each participant comf_mean: mean of comfort1 and comfort2 for each participant. total_hr: the total amount of hours in a week We can achieve the above with many different ways, for this term we will focus on using the function mutate(). ## when using mutate, we have to declare the dataframe first ## then give the name of the new variable ## and then type in the calculation we want to do ## the mean is nothing else than adding all variables ## and then dividing by the number of variables ## NOTE: you do not have to breat the mutate line in two lines ## like below, we did that so it fits in the pdf width df &lt;- mutate(df, use_mean = (use1 + use2 + use3 + use4 + use5 + use6)/6) df &lt;- mutate(df, pre_mean = (pre1 + pre2 + pre3 + pre4 + pre5 + pre6)/6) df &lt;- mutate(df, comf_mean = (comfort1 + comfort2)/2) ## we can also do any other type of arithmetic calculation ## for example total_hr = days * hours df &lt;- mutate(df, total_hr = days*hours) We can now create simple scatterplots between between our newly created variables. Below, we only give you only one example but try to complete the rest on your own. We can also carry out a correlation analysis between two variables. Again, we give you only one example, you should do the rest on your own during the lab session. ## a simple scatterplot between use_mean and pre_mean ggscatter(df, x = &quot;use_mean&quot;, y = &quot;pre_mean&quot;) ## a simple correlation analysis between cor_test(data = df, x = &quot;use_mean&quot;, y = &quot;pre_mean&quot;, method = &quot;pearson&quot;) ## change the code as needed to see output for different pairs of ## variables. You should have all pairs of Use_mean, pre_mean, comf_mean, ## and total_hr 7.5 Creating a new dataset and executing all correlations at once As you have seen above it is quite a lot of work to keep typing the same code for each pair of variables. One way to overcome this is to use the function, correlation(). This function, takes as an input our entire dataframe and runs correlations for all the existing variables. The problem with this approach is that our dataframe may also have variables that we do not want to include. An easy way to fix this would be to create a new dataframe that only contains the variables we need. Then run correlation on the new dataframe. We can do that by using the function select() and declare the variables we want to copy to the new dataframe. ## first we declate that our dataframe is df ## then we declare the variables we want to copy over ## to the new dataframe which we can give any name we want. df2 &lt;- select(df, use_mean, pre_mean, comf_mean, total_hr) summary(df2) Running the above code would create a new dataframe called **df2*. We can now run all the correlations between our four variables. ## all we have to do is declare the dataframe name ## in the correlation function correlation(data = df2, method = &quot;pearson&quot;) If you observe the output you will see that we have a row for each pair of variables. 7.6 Exercise Create the appropriate script that would allow you to load the datafile exercisew7.csv. This file contains the following columns: att1,att2,att3,bel1,bel2,bel3,bel4,stance1,stance2,stance3,stance4,ethic1,ethic2,ethic3. You should create new variables that would be the average of the following: att_mean: att1, att2, att3 bel_mean: bel1, bel2, bel3, bel4 stance_mean: stance1,stance2,stance3,stance4 ethic_mean: ethic1, ethic2, ethic3 Then explore correlations by creating scatterplots for the above four variables. Also, create a new datafile that will only include these four variables and run all correlations at once using the new dataframe.

Which one is entirely up to you. However, make sure you link the four in your introduction so that your hypothesis and rationale behind the study are sound. You will have to produce a group report of 2,000 words (maximum). In this word count the references and the appendices are not included. In other words, the word count includes everything you have written from the abstract until the end of your discussion. This limit is the absolute maximum, which means you cannot go above it, you can however write below 2,000 words. On Moodle, there is a template file that you will have to use to write the report. You have to use that file as we want you to also fill in the first pages of the report. In these pages all group members will be listed and you will have to acknowledge all the members that actually attended and contributed. This is crucial as we want to be fair and only award students who have worked on the project. 10.2 Psychological constructs in our study For the purposes of this report you will only need to work and analyse four variables. Two of them are compulsory, these are Maths Anxiety and Testing Anxiety. From the following list you can choose any other two you want. You have to have a total of four variables in your work. Maths Anxiety Testing Anxiety Computer Programming Anxiety Studying Efforts Programming experience (experience) Programming Progress (happy) Test Progress (tests) Test Preparation (test_hours) Test Perseverance (test_attempts) Test Performance (test_result) Programming Skills (skills) 10.3 Week 10 Session You should have already chosen your four variables and today y ou should focus on completing all the analysis for them. You should work together as a group and bring your dataset in a form where you can carry out correlational analysis. If you have createrd a project in RStudio in week 9 then you should continue working in that same project. This means that you have already downloaded the file project data.csv. If not then you should create a new project in RStudio and You should download the project data.csv file from moodle and save it in your project folder. You should then assign it to a dataframe and start working towards your analysis.Once the following is completed without any errors you should be good to start working within your group. If you have done that last week then you can skip this step. library(tidyverse) library(correlation) library(ggpubr) df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;project data.csv&quot;) 10.4 Data Preparation Before we are in a position to run our correlations we first have to calculate our questionnaires scores. In this study you completed a number of questions. We will not be analysing all of them. Instead we will only focus on. On Moodle, we have provided you with a pdf file that icludes most of the questions in this study. This file is called Qualtrics Survey.pdf. Make sure you download that file too and open it to familiarise yourself with the question. Next week we will be discussing the methods section, so this document will be useful for the completion of a number of sections in your report. You will only need to prepare the variables you chose and not all of them. 10.5 Maths Anxiety Scale (UK) This questionnaire is comprised of 23 items MAS_UK_1 to MAS_UK_23. It is scored on a 5-point Likert scale, not at all (1), to very much (5). You should calculate the sum for all the above items and name the variable MAS. 10.6 Test Anxiety Inventory This questionnaire is comprised of 20 items TAI_1 to TAI_20. It is scored on a 4-point Likert scale, Almost Never (1), Sometimes (2), Often (3), and Almost Always (4). You should calculate the sum of the above items and name the variable TAI. 10.6.1 Computer Programming Anxiety (CPAQ) (Brief Version) This brief version of the questionnaire is comprised of 15 items. The full version of the questionnaire is much longer. However, for the purposes of our coursework this brief versions will be more than suitable. These 15 items are: 1. GICS_1 to GIS_4 (Gaining Initial Computing Skills, GICS). 2. SoC_1 to SoC_3 (Sense of Control, SOC). 3. CSC_1 to CSC_4 (Computer Self Concept, CSC). 4. SACS_1 to SACS_4 (State of Anxiety in Computer Situations, SACS). You should calculate four means. The GICS, SOC, CSC, and the SACS. Once you have these four means then you need to calculate a final variable called CPAQ that will be average of GICS, SOC, CSC, and the SACS. 10.7 Computer Programming Anxiety (CPAQ) Prior to joing our course We also included a custom version of the above questionnaire where we asked you about your thoughts prior to joining our course. These items are similar with the above. We added the **_P** in the items names. So these items are GICS_P_1 to GIS_P_4, SoC_P_1 to SoC_P_3, CSC_P_1 to CSC_P_4, and SACS_P_1 to SACS_P_4. You should calculate four means. The GICS_P, SOC_P, CSC_P, and the SACS_P. Once you have these four means then you need to calculate a final variable called CPAQ that will be average of GICS, SOC, CSC, and the SACS. 10.8 Studying Efforts This one does not need any preparation and can be used as is. Refer to the questionnaire to see how the question was asked. 10.9 Programming experience (experience) This one does not need any preparation and can be used as is. Refer to the questionnaire to see how the question was asked. 10.10 Programming Progress (happy) This one does not need any preparation and can be used as is.

Refer to the questionnaire to see how the question was asked. 10.14 Test Performance (test_result) This variable requires some preparation. Some students responded using 0-10 scale and some using 0-100. You should convert all answers to either 0-10 or 0-100 before you can use the variable. 10.15 Programming Skills (skills) This one does not need any preparation and can be used as is. Refer to the questionnaire to see how the question was asked. 10.16 Create a new dataframe that will only contain your 4 variables In order to make your work simpler you should create a new dataframe called df2 that will only contain the four variables of your choice. You can do that using the function select(). We have used select() in the past so you refer to your notes on how to use itm, or use the help facility of RStudio. 10.17 Analysis needed for your report For your report you will need many different components that will go in different sections. Today we will focus on the Results section. For each of the *above calculatedfour variables you will need to create/report the following: Mean, standard deviation, IQR and range (this should go in the Results section) A histogram for each variable including a line for the mean and a line for the median (This should go in the Appendices) Furthermore, you will need to carry out the correlational analysis and include the following: All correlation coeeficients between all your four variable as well as the p-values. hese should be reported in a table that will be formatted according to the American Psychological Association guidelines (APA 7). This should go in your results section We also want to see the scatterplots for all variable combinations (the four you chose). These should go in the Appendices. **NOTE: For all histograms and scatterplots we expect to see clear titles, x and y-axes labes, and legends. So make sure you format them correctly (according to APA) but also include the expected content. 10.18 Wrapping up Once you have finished all the above you should write a draft version of the results section so we can finalise them in the coming up Practical Session.
