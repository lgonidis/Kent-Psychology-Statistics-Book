These are the aims of this introductory session, so today we will not be doing any programming in R or any statistical analysis. Instead we will be doing some basic files and folders tasks that will prepare us for the next weeks. 1.2 Common Practices It will be a common practice in our PSYC3000 course to create a new Project every week. This will help us keep our work organised and it has a number of benefits. It will be easier to communicate with your Associate Lecturers It will be easier to communicate with your fellow students It will get you into the habit to keep your work organised. This is crucial in data analysis and programming. 1.3 A Note About the Following Tasks We encourage all students to work on their own laptops, if possible. However, for todays lab session we want you to complete the following tasks using a University computer first. Later if you want, you can repeat these steps in your own computer. 1.4 First Task Regardless of whether you are working on your own computer or on a University one you should create a folder that you will be using to create all future projects. On your desktop, create a folder called PSYC3000 Labs. There are many different ways to achieve that, the quickest one is to right-click on your desktop, then select new and then folder. Make sure you name the folder PSYC3000 Labs. 1.5 Second Task: Create your first project Run RStudio on a University Lab computer. We want you to create your first project in the newly created folder PSYC3000 Labs. On RStudio, click on File, then New Project. You will see a pop-up window with three options. Click on New Directory. You should always be creating New projects in their own new directory. Next, you will see a number of different options, click on the top one New Project. You will now be asked to name the directory of your new Project. We want you to name it Week 9. Furthermore, we want this directory to be in the PSYC3000 folder. By they way directory is just an old school term for folder. Folder and directory are the same thing. So, click Browse next, then find the folder PSYC3000 on your desktop and select it and click Open. Finally, click Create Project. 1.6 Third Task: Have a look at how your RStudio looks If all went well then you should be seeing three main blocks in front of you, called panes. The Console/Terminal/Jobs one, the Environment/History/Connections/Tutorial, and the Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer one. Do not worry if they look a bit scary, we will talk more about them next week. For the time being we will only focus on the console. You should be able to see the prompt flashing next to an arrow. If you start typing you should be able to see the text appearing in front of you. Let us try to type the following Hello There and then press ENTER. You should be seeing a message in front of you. 1.7 Fourth Task: Labs are integrated with the Moodle Module Participation Component As mentioned in our Drop-In session and in our Module Outline, PSYC3000 have an assessed Module Participation component. This means you will have to complete a number of tasks every week in order to receive 10% at the end of the Autumn Term. Please do not close your RStudio. Go on Moodle, in Week 9, and then in the Moodle Module Participation section you should be able to see an activity called Week 9: Introductory Quiz. Click on it and answer the first question. This will be one of the ways that you will have to complete the weekly module participation component through your lab session. There will also be other ways that we will discuss in the future. You can take this quiz as many times as you want. 1.8 Fifth Task: Let us go back to RStudio again Back in RStudio, and in your Console type in 131 + 145 and hit ENTER. You should be able to see a result now, this is because the RStudio console can mathematical operations by default. Go back to the Week 9: Introductory Quiz answer the second question. The console can also run R commands and we will be using quite a lot in the next weeks. 1.9 Final Task: Let us create our first script Before we wrap it up for today let us create our first basic script. We will be discussing next week what scripts are and why they are useful. For now, we only want to create one. Go back to RStudio and click on File then New File then R Script. How many panes do you see now on your screen? Type that answer in the Quiz, in Question 3. 1.10 And that is all for today You should still have plenty of time left. We recommend that you spend familiarising yourself with RStudio. One way to do that is to repeat all the above steps on your laptop. Another way to do that is try out different looks for RStudio. If you want to do that click on Tools, Global Options, Appearance. There you can select different RStudio theme, font, and Editor theme. Feel free to experiment with different looks by clicking Apply and then going back and choosing another theme. If instead you are having difficulties installing RStudio on your laptop then ask our Associate Lecturers to direct to you to our tech support. "]]
